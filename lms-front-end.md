## 🎯 Introduction: Building a Future-Proof LMS

Project Abaq is a modern Learning Management System (LMS) tailored for students, teachers, and administrators. This document outlines our strategic technical choices aimed at ensuring long-term scalability, performance, and developer efficiency. Technologies such as React, Next.js, a Turborepo-managed monorepo, and a multi-app structure have been chosen for specific, impactful reasons.

## 💡 Core Technology: React & Next.js – A Powerful Duo

### 🧱 Why React?

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable UI blocks like buttons, forms, and course cards streamline development and UI consistency.
- **Rich Ecosystem & Community**: Broad library support and a large developer base help us stay innovative and supported.
- **Performance**: The Virtual DOM enables fast updates and smooth interactions.
- **Stability & Maturity**: Trusted by major organizations, React ensures long-term reliability.

### ⚙️ Why Next.js?

- **Versatile Rendering**:
  - **SSR**: Faster load and SEO for public-facing pages.
  - **SSG**: Ideal for static content.
  - **CSR**: Used for interactive internal portals.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Code splitting, prefetching, image optimization.
- **Developer Experience**: File-based routing, TypeScript, API routes.
- **Built-in API Routes**: Enables Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) patterns.

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway**: React gives us powerful UI building blocks, while Next.js adds structure and performance, making development more efficient and robust.

## 🏗️ Architectural Strategy: Monorepo & Multi-App Structure

### 📦 Why a Monorepo (via Turborepo)?

Managing all applications and packages in a single repository offers massive development and operational advantages:

- **Shared Code & Logic**:
  - UI Components, API clients, hooks, etc.
- **Consistent Tooling**: Shared ESLint, Prettier, and TS configs.
- **Streamlined Collaboration**: Easier atomic commits and refactors.
- **Optimized CI/CD**: Smart rebuilds and remote caching with Turborepo.
