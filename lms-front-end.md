## 🎯 Introduction: Building a Future-Proof LMS

This document outlines the key technical decisions made for Project Abaq, our Learning Management System. The choices of **React with Next.js**, a **Monorepo architecture powered by Turborepo**, and a **multi-app structure** were made strategically to ensure scalability, maintainability, developer efficiency, and a superior user experience. We'll also touch upon recent enhancements like our streamlined localization system.

Our goal is to build a robust platform that caters effectively to students, teachers, and administrators, today and in the future.

## 💡 Core Technology: React & Next.js - A Powerful Duo

Choosing the right frontend technology is paramount. We've selected React and Next.js for compelling reasons:

###  alasan 1: Why React?

* **Component-Based Architecture:**
    * Reusable UI components (buttons, forms, course cards) accelerate development and ensure UI consistency across all applications.
    * Simplifies complex UIs by breaking them into manageable, independent pieces.
* **Rich Ecosystem & Community:**
    * Vast availability of libraries, tools, and community support means faster problem-solving and access to cutting-edge solutions.
    * Easier to find skilled developers.
* **Virtual DOM for Performance:**
    * Efficiently updates the UI, leading to faster rendering and a smoother experience for users interacting with course content, exams, and live sessions.
* **Strong Industry Adoption:**
    * React is a proven technology used by many large-scale applications, instilling confidence in its stability and future.

### alasan 2: Why Next.js (The React Framework)?

Next.js builds upon React, providing a comprehensive framework that addresses many common development needs out-of-the-box:

* **Versatile Rendering Options:**
    * **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Improves initial page load performance and SEO for public-facing student pages (e.g., course listings on `abaq.com`).
    * **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Ideal for content that doesn't change often, offering blazing-fast load times.
    * **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Standard React behavior, perfect for dynamic, interactive dashboards within the teacher and admin portals.
* **Optimized Performance:**
    * Automatic code splitting, image optimization, and smart prefetching lead to faster applications.
* **Enhanced Developer Experience (DX):**
    * File-system routing, built-in TypeScript support, fast refresh, and integrated API routes streamline development.
* **SEO Friendliness:**
    * SSR capabilities are crucial for making our main student portal (`abaq.com`) discoverable by search engines.
* **API Routes:**
    * Allows us to create backend endpoints within our Next.js apps, perfect for BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) patterns, simplifying data fetching and mutations for each specific application.

> **Key Takeaway:** React provides the powerful UI building blocks, while Next.js offers the structure, performance, and features needed to build modern, scalable web applications efficiently.

## 🏗️ Architectural Strategy: Monorepo & Multi-App Structure

Our architectural approach is designed for efficiency, clarity, and scalability.

### alasan 3: Why a Monorepo (with Turborepo)? 📦

A monorepo means managing all our distinct application codebases (`student`, `teacher`, `admin`, `auth`) and shared packages within a single repository. We're using **Turborepo** to optimize this.

* **Efficient Code Sharing:**
    * **Shared UI Components:** Buttons, layouts, form elements are built once and used across all apps.
    * **Shared Logic/Hooks:** Utility functions, API clients, and custom hooks (e.g., for data fetching) are centralized.
    * **Consistent Tooling:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript configurations are shared, ensuring code quality and consistency.
    * **Example:** Our new `localization-middleware` is a shared package, effortlessly integrated into all apps.
* **Streamlined Development & Collaboration:**
    * Atomic commits/PRs for features spanning multiple apps.
    * Easier to refactor and keep dependencies in sync.
* **Optimized Build & CI/CD Pipelines:**
    * Turborepo intelligently understands dependencies and only rebuilds/retests what's affected by a change, significantly speeding up build times.
    * Remote caching further accelerates builds.
* **Simplified Dependency Management:** Manage versions of common libraries in one place.

alasan 4: Why Separate Applications? 🧩We've intentionally split the LMS into distinct applications based on user roles and functionality:abaq.com (Student App): Main domain, focused on student experience – course enrollment, learning, exams.teacher.abaq.com (Teacher App): Subdomain for teachers – course management, live sessions, exam correction.admin.abaq.com (Admin App): Subdomain for management – system control, user management, content oversight.auth.abaq.com (Auth App): Centralized login/registration, redirecting users to their respective dashboards.Benefits of This Separation:Clear Separation of Concerns (SoC):Each app has a focused responsibility, making its codebase cleaner, easier to understand, and manage.Independent Deployments & Scalability:Each app can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently. A critical fix in the admin app doesn't require redeploying the student app.Allows for tailored infrastructure for each app if needed (e.g., admin app might have stricter IP whitelisting).Tailored User Experiences (UX):Optimize the UI, features, and performance for each specific user role.The student app can be highly visual and engaging, while the admin app can be more data-dense and utilitarian.Enhanced Security Boundaries:Easier to manage security policies and access controls when applications are separated by domain.Reduces the attack surface for any single application.Optimized Team Workflows: Different teams (if applicable in the future) could potentially own different applications.Application Interaction & Authentication Flow:graph LR

Key Takeaway: The monorepo provides the "glue" and efficiency for our multi-app setup, allowing us to build specialized applications without sacrificing shared standards or development speed.✨ Feature Highlight: Seamless Localization (ar/en)A recent success story showcasing the power of our monorepo and Next.js is the implementation of localization.Shared Middleware Package:We developed a localization-middleware package within our monorepo.This middleware is easily consumed by all Next.js applications (student, teacher, admin, auth).Functionality:Detects user's preferred language (from browser settings, cookies, or explicit choice).If a user navigates to a non-localized URL (e.g., abaq.com/my-learning), they are automatically redirected to the localized version (e.g., abaq.com/ar/my-learning or abaq.com/en/my-learning).Supports Arabic (ar) and English (en).Benefits:Consistency: Uniform localization behavior across all parts of the platform.Maintainability: Localization logic is centralized, making updates and bug fixes simpler.Improved User Experience: Provides a seamless experience for users in their preferred language from the moment they land.Rapid Implementation: The monorepo structure allowed us to roll this out efficiently across all apps.Localization Flow:graph TD
